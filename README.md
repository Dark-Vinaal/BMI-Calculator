# BMI Calculator - Project

A responsive, web-based BMI calculator featuring light and dark themes, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧮 Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator 📏

This repository contains a fully functional, browser-based BMI calculator. Developed using standard front-end technologies.

## Overview

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a dedicated web application designed to help users quickly and conveniently assess their body weight status. By taking inputs for height and weight, the application calculates the user's BMI, a standard metric used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems. This project is a foundational showcase of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration, providing immediate, actionable feedback to the user.

## Key Features & Functionality

The application follows a straightforward and efficient process :

- Metric Data Input: The user provides their height (typically in meters or feet/inches, depending on the implementation) and weight (typically in kilograms or pounds) into clearly labeled input fields.
- Precise Calculation: Using the formula,
 
  > $\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}$
  
  the core JavaScript logic computes the user's Body Mass Index.
- Categorical Interpretation: The calculated numerical BMI is then instantly translated into a corresponding weight status category

  > (e.g., Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese).

  This crucial interpretation makes the result meaningful to the user.

- User-Friendly Display: The final result, including both the numerical BMI value and the interpretive category, is displayed prominently in the user interface
